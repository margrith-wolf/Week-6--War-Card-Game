WEEK 6 FINAL PROJECT

Create an automated version of the classic card game WAR! There are many versions of the game WAR.

Consider classes such as: Card, Deck, Player, as well as what properties and methods they may include.

Do not accept any user input. The entire game should play out instantly without any user input inside of your browserâ€™s console.

The completed project should, when executed, do the following:
- Deal 26 Cards to 2 Players from a Deck of 52 cards.
- Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.
- The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point
- Ties result in zero points for both Players
- After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.

Write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of the functions you write.
